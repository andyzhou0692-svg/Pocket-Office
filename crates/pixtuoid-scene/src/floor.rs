//! Multi-floor office partitioning.
//!
//! When more agents are active than `max_desks` can seat on a single floor,
//! the scene is split into multiple floors. This module provides the pure
//! arithmetic (which floor does desk N belong to? how many floors exist?),
//! the per-floor rendering context (`FloorCtx`) so each floor owns its own
//! router, overlay, pose history, and frame cache — and, since #423, the
//! shared headless frame seam ([`render_floor`]) plus the per-office
//! [`CoffeeState`] bookkeeping every painter routes through.
