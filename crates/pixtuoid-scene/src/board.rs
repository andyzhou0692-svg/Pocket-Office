//! the plain-English mood pulse echoing the shared `StateCounts` (L2), and the
//! office-context row (L3: uptime · floor · gateway chip). Three painters render
//! it: the TUI (ratatui `Paragraph`), the floating window (AA Monaspace Neon
//! blitted into its surface), and the wasm hero (exported to a DOM overlay).
//! `scene` has no terminal/window deps (invariant #1), so the model carries a
//! backend-agnostic `BoardTone`; `tone_rgb` (here) is the ONE tone→theme-role map
//! all three painters share — each only converts the resolved `Rgb` to its own
//! surface color type (ratatui `Color` / packed XRGB / `#hex`), so the hues can't
//! drift across surfaces.
//!
//! This module ALSO owns the shared per-scene activity tally (`StateCounts` +
//! `scene_stats`/`per_floor_counts`/`gateway_rollup`) — pure, backend-free, and
//! now reachable by every painter crate (the binary's footer AND `pixtuoid-web`),
//! which is why it moved here out of the binary's tui widgets.
