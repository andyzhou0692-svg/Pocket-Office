//! painter (`render_to_rgb_buffer` — the shared world render), themes, pets,
//! chitchat, and the embedded sprite pack. It has **no** terminal or window
//! dependency — `tui` (ratatui half-block) and `floating` (winit/softbuffer)
//! are thin painters layered on top, and neither depends on the other.

// Terminal- and window-free (invariant #1, crate-boundary enforced). The dep
// boundary can't see a raw `println!` (std, no dep); this restriction lint does
// (a hard error under the workspace `-D warnings`). Non-test builds only, so
// test diagnostics may print freely.

// true` cannot be combined with a per-crate `[lints.rust]` table.
