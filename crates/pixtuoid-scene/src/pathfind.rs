//! Pathfinding façade — `Router` trait + `AStarRouter` impl.
//!
//! `Router` is the abstraction the renderer codes against: give it a static
//! `WalkableMask` and a per-frame `OccupancyOverlay`, ask for a polyline
//! from A to B, get back the route. The trait stays small so future impls
//! (Theta*, HPA*, navmesh) can drop in without touching `pose.rs` or
//! `renderer.rs`.
//!
//! `AStarRouter` is the concrete impl: A* on a coarsened 4×4 cell grid
//! with a permissive cell-walkability threshold (≥8/16 px walkable, 50% —
//! see `layout::coarse::COARSE_CELL_WALKABLE_MIN` for why tighter thresholds
//! were rejected). The coarse-grid primitives (`cell_walkable`/`snap`/
//! `NEIGHBORS_8`/`CELL_SIZE`) are the SHARED `layout::coarse` ones `layout::reach`
//! also rides, so router reachability can't drift from `ReachSet`. Memoizes
//! results in a per-(from, to) cache; auto-invalidates when the overlay
//! signature changes so per-frame agent movement still routes around live agents.
