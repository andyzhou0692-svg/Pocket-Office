//! Request-based room walls: each room DECLARES the edges it needs enclosed
//! (horizontal/vertical runs only) plus the doors it wants in them; the
//! resolver merges duplicate requests (two stacked rooms both request their
//! shared boundary — it renders as ONE wall), unions their door requests,
//! trims vertical runs below crossing horizontal wall bodies, and cuts the
//! gaps. Walls are therefore a FUNCTION of the room set — the old
//! `compute_room_walls` derived them from the same scalars the rooms were
//! computed from (parallel geometry, drift-prone; the #556 bookshelf-pierce
//! bug was exactly a "decor can't see the wall" blind spot).
//!
//! Door policy is the ROOMS' (owner call, #557 grill): a meeting room opens
//! a centered door in its east (corridor) wall; the pantry opens the
//! meeting↔pantry door at 60% of the shared wall; two stacked meeting rooms
//! declare NO door on their shared wall — it renders solid (each room has
//! its own corridor door, so connectivity holds; pinned by the sweep's BFS).
