//! The generative placement-invariant sweep — the MECHANISM for testing
//! furniture placement, not another pile of per-piece tests.
//!
//! Every invariant here is derived from the `FurnitureDef` table + the
//! `SceneLayout` collections, swept across a sizes × seeds grid that folds in
//! every corner size the retired hand-written tests encoded. Two teeth make
//! this a harness rather than more tests:
//!
//! 1. **Single-source geometry** — piece rects come from the SAME
//!    `mask::ground_rect` / `mask::pantry_ground_rect` the walkable mask
//!    stamps, so the sweep can never drift from the collision truth.
//! 2. **Exhaustive enumeration** — [`pieces`] destructures `SceneLayout`
//!    field-by-field with NO `..`: adding a new furniture collection fails
//!    compilation HERE until the new field is either fed into the sweep or
//!    explicitly exempted with a WHY. New furniture cannot ship unpinned.
//!
//! What deliberately does NOT live here: the FurnitureDef table's own axioms
//! (decor.rs tests), stamp/anchor algebra (mask.rs/placement.rs tests),
//! approach/reach/pathfind semantics on synthetic masks, and the render
//! layer's z-sort/occlusion suite — re-asserting those would make one table
//! edit fail two suites. Position-STABILITY stays with the insta goldens.
