//!
//! Splits a buf-pixel rectangle into quadrants (meeting / pantry /

//! waypoints, decor positions, and a per-pixel walkability mask.

//! Submodules:
//!   * `decor` — the furniture/decor vocabulary: the role enums

//!     `Furniture` geometry table they map onto.
//!   * `compute` — `compute_with_seed`: desk/decor/wall/waypoint placement.
//!   * `placement` — the `Anchor` convention (where a box sits vs its `pos`).
//!   * `mask` — `build_walkable_mask`: stamps obstacle footprints for routing.
//!   * `approach` — `stand_point`/`approach_point`: where an agent stands to use a piece.
//!   * `coarse` — the SHARED coarse routing-grid primitives (`cell_walkable`/`snap`/
//!     `NEIGHBORS_8`/`COARSE_CELL_SIZE`) that BOTH `reach` and `crate::pathfind` ride.
//!   * `reach` — `ReachSet`: coarse-cell BFS (over `coarse`) mirroring `crate::pathfind`'s A* grid.
