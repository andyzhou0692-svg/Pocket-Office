//! Pure state → pose derivation — every renderer (tui, floating, snapshot
//! tooling, web canvas) gets identical pose semantics from this one file.
//!
//! `derive(slot, now, layout)` is a function of the snapshot inputs only —
//! no routing, no per-frame history. The routed variant (which composes
//! against a `Router` and a `PoseHistory` cache) is the sibling
//! `pose/mod.rs` (`derive_with_routing`) — the pure-vs-routed split is
//! file-level within this module.
//!
//! Variation knobs:
//!  * `stale_resume_gap_ms(agent_id)` — per-agent off-screen-gap sentinel (NOT the
//!    wander cycle; that's `est_wander_cycle_ms`): if `advance_wander` hasn't run
//!    for this long the floor was off-screen/paused, so re-bootstrap analytically.
//!    Range 7..13s, jittered so floors don't all re-bootstrap in lockstep.
//!  * Waypoint choice XORs `agent_id` with the current cycle number, so each
//!    cycle the same agent picks a (likely) different waypoint.
