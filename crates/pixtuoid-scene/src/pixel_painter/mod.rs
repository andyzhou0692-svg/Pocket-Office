//! Pure-pixel paint pass — no ratatui types, no terminal I/O.
//!
//! Split from `tui/renderer.rs` to separate the pixel-painting pipeline
//! (called by any renderer impl — `TuiRenderer`, a future web canvas, PNG
//! export, GIF capture) from the ratatui-coupled half-block flush + widget
//! overlay (terminal lifecycle lives with the event loop in `tui/mod.rs`).
//!
//! `render_to_rgb_buffer` is the public entry point, and is itself TWO
//! phases behind one seam: [`sim_step`] (the `sim` module) advances the
//! world — motion, poses, lighting, chitchat — with no pixel access and
//! returns an immutable [`SimFrame`]; the paint pass (`paint_frame`)
//! consumes `&SimFrame` and mutates only the buffer + the paint-local
//! `FrameCache`. Everything else is private to this module except
//! `character_anchor`, which `widgets.rs` uses for label placement and
//! `hit_test.rs` for mouse hit-testing.
