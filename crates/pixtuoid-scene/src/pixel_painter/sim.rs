//! The SIM half of the frame — advance the world, produce no pixels.
//!
//! `render_to_rgb_buffer` used to fuse sim-step and paint in one pass:
//! `PixelCtx` carried six `&mut` sim stores, so there was no way to advance
//! motion/lifecycle/venue state without painting, and no way to observe the
//! outcomes except through a full render. The split: [`sim_step`] mutates the
//! [`SimStores`] and returns an immutable [`SimFrame`] snapshot; the paint
//! pass (still inside `render_to_rgb_buffer`) consumes `&SimFrame` and only
//! ever writes the pixel buffer + the paint-local `FrameCache` (a render
//! cache, deliberately NOT a sim store). Headless consumers drive
//! `floor::FloorSession::observe` (the facade over `sim_step`) to observe
//! poses/positions without buying a pixel pass.
//!
//! Store classification (what makes something SIM vs PAINT):
//! * SIM — state that advances with time and must persist across frames:
//!   `router` (A* cache), `overlay` (per-tick occupancy), `history` (pose
//!   continuity), `motion` (walk legs/wander timeline), `light` (occupancy
//!   fade), `chitchat` (venue conversations).
//! * PAINT-LOCAL — `FrameCache` (recolored-sprite cache): flushing it changes
//!   no behavior, only repaint cost. It stays on the paint side.
