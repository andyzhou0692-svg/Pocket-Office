# pixtuoid (binary) — agent guide

The **TUI binary**: `ratatui` + `crossterm` + `winit` + `tokio` + `clap`. Wires
sources → reducer → renderer, owns the CLI subcommands, hook installation, config
persistence, and multi-floor orchestration. The backend-agnostic render +
simulation **engine** (layout, pose/motion/pathfinding, the pixel pass, the theme
model, pets, chitchat) is its OWN dependency crate `pixtuoid-scene` (it used to be
an in-binary module) — see [`../pixtuoid-scene/CLAUDE.md`](../pixtuoid-scene/CLAUDE.md);
the DAG is `pixtuoid-core ← pixtuoid-scene ← {pixtuoid, pixtuoid-web}`. This
binary's two thin painters **over the `pixtuoid-scene` crate** are the terminal
renderer `src/tui/` ([`src/tui/CLAUDE.md`](src/tui/CLAUDE.md)) and the
`floating/` desktop window (neither depends on the other); the wasm `<canvas>`
painter is the SIBLING crate `pixtuoid-web`. Cross-cutting rules: workspace
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md); headless-lib detail:
[`../pixtuoid-core/CLAUDE.md`](../pixtuoid-core/CLAUDE.md).

## Layout

src/
├── main.rs             entry point — arg-parse + dispatch + env glue ONLY (color/truecolor

│                       failure eprintlns pre-altscreen). The crash hook, logging bootstrap,
│                       and sources-CLI presenters are BIN-CRATE modules it declares
│                       (crash.rs / logging.rs / sources_cli.rs — pub(crate), same src/ dir
│                       as the lib but NOT in lib.rs; all three codecov-excluded like main.rs)
├── crash.rs            install_crash_hook — panic hook → terminal restore, timestamped

│                       issue URL (percent-encode / char-boundary-truncate helpers unit-tested)
├── logging.rs          log routing (#157): logging::init installs the ONE tracing subscriber —

│                       is indistinguishable from the default and floors to warn); non-TUI
│                       modes log to stderr; log_file_path is the shared path authority
│                       (doctor dispatch + sources_cli + RunConfig.log_path read it)
├── cli.rs              clap subcommands (run / floating / validate-pack / init-pack / doctor / sources / connect /
│                       disconnect / setup / completions / man). The OLD install-hooks/uninstall-hooks CLI stays deleted
│                       (#284 removed the interactive ORCHESTRATION — plan_targets/interactive_pick); `connect <ids>`/
│                       `disconnect <ids>`/`sources [set <ids>]` are the SCRIPTABLE surface (Raycast/automation), a second
│                       presenter over crate::sources (see the scriptable-vs-interactive sharp edge); `setup [--yes]` is
│                       the headless onboarding twin (dry-run preview / apply); the in-TUI Sources panel (`s`) remains the
│                       INTERACTIVE one. `completions <shell>` (clap_complete) + hidden `man` (clap_mangen) emit to stdout
│                       from the SAME derived Cli tree as `--help` (homebrew `generate_completions_from_executable` / `man`
│                       capture them); main.rs dispatches both as plain arms (tracing → stderr, so stdout stays clean). Every
│                       PathBuf arg carries `value_hint` so completions path-complete (currently six: the four
│                       flattened SourceArgs flags + validate-pack's dir + init-pack's dest). Presenters live in

│                       determined — COLORTERM / terminal query / downsamples / unknown). main.rs WARN-ONLY (never gates on

│                       call site. `doctor` runs the query ONLY when stdout is a tty (piped `doctor > file` neither emits
│                       escape codes nor probes — also why the test harness, output captured, never probes). Windows
│                       hard-gates VT separately (tui/mod); `query_truecolor` is a `None` stub there. `floating` is exempt
│                       (softbuffer = real RGB px). **Sharp edges:** a truecolor terminal that doesn't answer DECRQSS (rare)
│                       false-positives → the escape hatch covers it; a very-laggy reply past the 100ms budget could leak a
│                       few bytes to the TUI's stdin (accepted, rare). The query is the authority — there is NO $TERM/
│                       $TERM_PROGRAM allowlist to keep current (deleted on purpose; that was the "magic variable" smell).
│                       SEPARATE axis (color ON/OFF, not depth): `color_preflight(no_color, clicolor_force, term)` →
│                       `ColorPreflight` {Proceed / ForceColor / RefuseNoColor / RefuseDumbTerm}. The office is 24-bit with
│                       NO legible monochrome fallback, so when color is disabled we REFUSE the canvas + explain (mirrors the

│                       crossterm — the thing that strips); `$FORCE_COLOR`/`$CLICOLOR` are deliberately NOT read (crossterm
│                       keys only on `$NO_COLOR`, so they'd no-op the render). Gated to the `run` TUI only (--headless/doctor/sources are plain

│                       policy so the diagnostic matches `run`; doctor also SKIPS the DECRQSS probe under `$TERM=dumb`).
│                       **Sharp edge:** tmux (#4034) doesn't implement DECRQSS, so a truecolor tmux can false-positive the
│                       depth warn — `$PIXTUOID_NO_TRUECOLOR_WARN=1` covers it (tmux usually sets `$COLORTERM`, skipping the

## Known sharp edges (don't be surprised by these)

- **Terminal cell aspect drives sprite design.** The half-block ▀ technique assumes ~1:2 cell aspect. Sprites larger than ~16×16 px break on terminals with taller cells (Ghostty default, large Fira Code). The bundled **character** sprites max at **8×12 px** (e.g. `standing`/`walking_*`), safely under the ~16×16 threshold; static environment art (door 16×14, pantry 32×10) is wider but isn't an animated half-block agent. A PNG-loader experiment hit this wall and was deleted in favor of hand-drawn `.sprite` art.
- **The seven-idle-avatar cap is a render-only lifecycle, not an immediate filter.** `runtime::VisualCoworkers` ranks the authoritative scene without mutating it. An idle agent that falls outside the visible set stays in the rendered clone with `exiting_at` set for `EXIT_GRACE_WINDOW`, so the shared scene engine completes its walk to the door before the clone hides it. The lifecycle latches `Hidden` after a completed exit so a backward clock step cannot resurrect the avatar, then clears the latch only when the id stops being excess. The shared pose engine clears its cached exit and path when an id is rendered without `exiting_at`, then snapshots a fresh exit on the next departure. This cancellation reset is required even when the paused TUI reuses the same timestamp. Replacing this lifecycle with `SceneState::agents.retain` makes avatars vanish between frames and bypasses both terminal and floating exit animation.
- **`--max-desks` has no hard default.** It's `Option<usize>` (hidden flag / `max-desks` config key) — when absent, per-floor capacity is auto-computed from terminal size at boot. `FALLBACK_DESKS = 16` (`runtime/mod.rs`) is used only in headless mode or when the terminal-size query errors. The auto path clamps each floor to its real layout capacity; if you add an explicit-cap boot path, clamp it the same way (don't seed the floor-capacity atomics above the layout's real capacity — `fetch_max` only grows, so an over-seed leaves agents assigned to non-existent desks until the terminal grows). **`max-desks` applies to `run` (TUI) only, NOT `floating`** — the desktop window seeds capacity purely from its window-pixel size (`floating::offscreen::boot_capacities_for_window` at boot + `window::sync_floor_caps` per redraw, both deriving buffer dims from the shared `offscreen::window_buffer_geometry` so the seed can't drift from the redraw; the TUI's footer-subtracting, `office_scale`-ignorant `runtime::boot_capacities_for` is deliberately NOT reused here — it over-seeds) and never reads `RunConfig.desk_cap`, so a `max-desks` config value is silently ignored there (a `max-desks = 0` still emits its `resolve_max_desks` warning during `build_run_config`, so only the legitimate positive-cap case is silent). The monotone `fetch_max` growth rule is TUI-only — `floating::window::sync_floor_caps` deliberately uses `store`: the window's pixel size is exact and authoritative per redraw, so a shrink LOWERS capacity (excess agents go invisible-but-alive); don't "harmonize" it to `fetch_max`.
- **Layout position overrides are TUI-only and floor-atomic.** `config::resolve_layout_overrides` groups `[[layout.positions]]` by zero-based floor; `TuiRenderer` installs each group on that floor's `FloorCtx`. The floor context invalidates its memo when the group changes, calls `SceneLayout::compute_with_seed_and_overrides`, and memoizes either the validated override layout or the complete procedural fallback. Do not apply these settings in `floating` or web, and do not partially keep valid entries from a rejected floor set.
- **Re-install is a SEMANTIC no-op, and backups APPEND their suffix.** `MergeOutcome.changed = merged != doc` (`install/claude.rs`) compares the *parsed/merged* config, NOT bytes — so a second connect (or a disconnect of an absent hook) detects "nothing changed", skips the write, and preserves the user's hand-formatting + skips backup churn. And `backup_once` names backups via `sibling()` = `format!("{}.{}", path, "pixtuoid.bak")` which **appends** — deliberately NOT `with_extension`, which would truncate `config.local.toml` → `config.local.pixtuoid.bak` (losing `.toml`). So a multi-dot config keeps its full name (`config.local.toml.pixtuoid.bak`). Both pinned by tests in `install/io.rs`.
- **Two surfaces bind a source, ONE core.** `crate::sources::{connect,disconnect}` (persist the `[sources]` flag + install/uninstall hooks + rollback) is the single seam; it has TWO presenters: (1) the **interactive** in-TUI Sources panel (`s` → `tui::connect_source`/`disconnect_source`, which delegate to the core and add the one live-gate line `connected.set` so a running office walks characters in/out NOW), and (2) the **scriptable** CLI (`pixtuoid connect/disconnect/sources [set]`, Raycast/automation/onboarding — NO live set; a running instance reflects it on next launch). This is NOT a re-litigation of #284 (which deleted the install-hooks CLI's interactive *orchestration*); it's a second presenter over the structured core (R0618-01). The CLI is persist-only by design — the live `ConnectedSources` is in-process, so a separate CLI process can't touch a running office. `connect` ERRs + rolls the flag back on install failure; `disconnect` reserves `Err` for the persist-abort and folds a hook-removal failure into the `Ok` outcome (`DisconnectOutcome::HookRemovalFailed` — the gate still closes, the flag is false; BOTH presenters surface it: the panel as "disconnected, but hook removal failed", the CLI as `disconnected (hook removal failed: …)` / `sources set` as a `hooks not removed: …` token — never a silent clean "disconnected"). `ConnectOutcome`/`DisconnectOutcome` carry the `Install/UninstallReport` so the panel renders rich notes while the CLI maps to a wire token. **The CLI honors the explicit id without the panel's `NoCli` guard** — `connect`/`sources set` install for any registered id even if that CLI isn't installed yet (pre-provisioning for automation; `detect()` returns only PRESENT CLIs so onboarding offers only installed ones), whereas the interactive panel refuses an absent CLI. The status MODEL (`ConnState`/`ConnectionRow`/`build_rows`) lives in `sources` (re-exported by `tui::connection`), so `sources::status` (the `SourceStatus` `--json` Raycast contract) doesn't depend on the painter.
- **`OutcomeRow` is `{id, outcome, message?}` — a bare machine token + a SEPARATE optional detail field.** The `--json` batch envelope (`connect`/`disconnect`/`sources set`) split the old folded `failed: <msg>` string into `outcome: "failed"` + `message: "<msg>"` (present exactly on failure, OMITTED — not null — on success) while the in-repo Raycast extension was still the ONLY consumer: it ships atomically with the binary and is NOT yet published to the Raycast store, so the breaking wire change was free — post-publication it would be expensive forever. The drift gate is the schema→codegen chain: `OutcomeRow` (schemars) → the committed `integrations/raycast/contract/outcome-row.schema.json` golden (`outcome_row_schema_matches_the_committed_contract`, regen via `just gen-contract`) → the generated Raycast TS type (`gen:contract`) → `tsc`; the exact bytes are pinned by `outcome_row_json_shape_is_the_raycast_contract` + the envelope test in `sources_cli.rs`, and the TOKEN set (`connected`/`disconnected`/`no_op`/`failed`) by `change_outcome_wire_tokens_are_stable`. `OutcomeRow::new` is the ONE outcome→row authority (both emitting surfaces route through it). **Once the extension publishes to the store this freedom ends**: installed copies parse the wire independently of the binary's version, so any further wire change needs a version handshake / deliberate coupled migration — not a flag-day edit like this one.
- **Code-artifact targets: install writes ⊆ verify checks (#387).** A `Target` ships CODE (not just a config block) two ways — opencode's TS plugin IS its `config_path` (so `verify_schema` over the config content covers it), and OpenClaw's JS plugin is a separate `extra_artifacts` DIR (so `install::verify_target` STATs each declared artifact for existence — a missing one is a HARD `doctor` break, #332, the silent-dead class the config-level check is blind to). `install_target`'s ENTIRE code-write surface is exactly those two paths, and BOTH are verify-covered. **The invariant for a future 3rd code-artifact target:** any NEW code-shipping path you add to `install_target` MUST gain a matching check in `verify_target`, or `doctor` reports the source HEALTHY while the runtime can't load it. Pinned generically by `verify_target_hard_flags_a_missing_code_artifact_for_every_extra_artifacts_target` (it loops EVERY `extra_artifacts` target, so a future one is auto-guarded — don't special-case OpenClaw back into it).

## Where to look

- "How do hooks get installed?" → `install::claude::merge_install` for the JSON merge logic (CC registers SEVEN events: SessionStart / PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Notification / **SubagentStart / SubagentStop** (#241 — instant subagent register + the only end signal Workflow-fleet subagents get) / SessionEnd; a re-run over an older install ADDS newly registered events idempotently, and uninstall strips them all via the `_pixtuoid` sentinel), `install::io::write_config_atomic` for the safe filesystem write. Multi-target install via the `install::target::Target` registry (`TARGETS = [CLAUDE, CODEX, REASONIX, CODEWHALE, OPENCODE, CURSOR, HERMES, OPENCLAW]`); the user picks a CLI to bind/unbind one row at a time in the in-TUI Sources panel (`s`) — there is no CLI-side target-selection orchestration (the old `plan_targets`/`interactive_pick`/confirm policy was deleted with the `install-hooks` CLI). **Unix:** Claude's `hook_command` emits bare `pixtuoid-hook` (shell-form entry, PATH-resolved at runtime); resolution is soft (warn-only) because the shell resolves it — EXCEPT when the user passed an explicit `--hook-path` (or the `PIXTUOID_HOOK` env override — the flag outranks it, empty/whitespace = unset via `io::nonempty_env`, drive-relative `C:foo.exe` bails, and it EMBEDS exactly like the flag), which always wins: the absolute path is embedded (single-quoted) for Claude too, matching Codex/Reasonix, and the PATH warning is skipped. Default config paths are fallible (`fn() -> Result<PathBuf>`): the home-anchored targets (Claude fallback arm, Reasonix) hard-error via `io::home_relative_checked` when no home dir resolves ("pass --config") instead of writing a CWD-relative file nothing reads; Codex routes through `codex_home()` (always absolute). **Windows:** `hook_command` returns the ABSOLUTE resolved `.exe` path; the hook entry gains `"args": []` (exec form — Git Bash/PowerShell make shell-form unportable); resolution is a HARD error because exec form can't fall back to PATH. Codex embeds the absolute path on all platforms; its hook `command` runs under a shell (`/bin/sh -lc` on Unix, `cmd.exe /C` on Windows — verified in codex-rs `command_runner.rs`, which runs the plain `command` field on every OS, so no `commandWindows` override is written for a locally-generated config). **Unix:** env-prefix form `PIXTUOID_SOURCE=codex '<path>'`. **Windows:** BARE exec form `<path> --source codex` (codex's own documented `command_windows` style). cmd.exe `/C` can't express the env-prefix (it would exec a program literally named `PIXTUOID_SOURCE=codex`), so the source rides as the shim's generic `--source` flag (the flag wins over `PIXTUOID_SOURCE`; either way the shim stamps `_pixtuoid_source`). We must NOT quote the path: codex spawns the hook via `Command::new(cmd.exe).arg("/C").arg(command)`, and `Command::arg`'s Windows escaping turns an embedded `"` into `\"`, which cmd.exe mangles → the hook silently never fires. codex injects no per-hook env we could use instead. A pixtuoid-hook.exe under a path with a SPACE/cmd-metacharacter can't be invoked unquoted, so `hook_cmd::windows::windows_bare_hook_command` substitutes the path's DOS 8.3 SHORT name (`GetShortPathNameW` — space/metachar-free) and only rejects if 8.3 generation is disabled on the volume (#195). The faithful cmd.exe round-trip is pinned by `pixtuoid-hook/tests/shim_pipe.rs::codex_cmd_c_invocation_of_hook_command_stamps_source` (windows-test). **Reasonix** mirrors Codex exactly (it also shells hooks via `cmd.exe /c` on Windows — `hook.go:414`): Unix env-prefix `PIXTUOID_SOURCE=reasonix`, Windows bare `<path> --source reasonix`. Both Codex and Reasonix route their Windows arm through **`hook_cmd::windows::windows_bare_hook_command(path, source)`** — the ONE place the bare-form + the cmd-unsafe-path handling (8.3 short-name substitution via `GetShortPathNameW`, else reject; chars `space tab ; , = " & | < > ( ) ^ %` — the first five are cmd.exe first-token DELIMITERS, and `; , =` are legal NTFS filename chars, #195) lives, so a security guard can't drift between targets. (Claude is the odd one out — it uses Windows *exec form* with an `args` array, not a shell string.) Reasonix's settings shape is its own FLAT per-event array (`{match?, command, timeout(ms), description}` — NOT Claude's nested `{matcher, hooks:[…]}`), the file is the GLOBAL `<reasonix-home>/settings.json` — `~/.reasonix/settings.json` on macOS/Linux but **`%APPDATA%\reasonix\settings.json` on Windows** (Reasonix's `ReasonixHomeDir` is platform-ASYMMETRIC: Go `os.UserConfigDir()/reasonix` on Windows, `~/.reasonix` elsewhere, `REASONIX_HOME` override; `reasonix::reasonix_home` mirrors it — writing the generic `~/.reasonix` on Windows would land hooks where Reasonix never reads, the %APPDATA% axis of the same Windows bug class) — project scope only loads after `/hooks trust` (a project-scope install would silently never fire), and `match` is OMITTED = every tool (upstream special-cases `"*"` to every-tool too; any other value is an ANCHORED regex where a malformed pattern never fires — omission is the simplest always-fires form); detection uses `reasonix::detect_installed` (a `presence_probe` on the Target) because Reasonix never creates the settings.json we write — it probes the v2 config dir (`os.UserConfigDir()/reasonix`) and `~/.reasonix` instead. The hook entry detection/uninstall keys on the `_pixtuoid` sentinel, not the command shape, so both forms are idempotent. **CodeWhale** writes `~/.codewhale/config.toml` (or legacy `~/.deepseek/config.toml` when that is the file it reads — mirrors CodeWhale's own `default_config_path` so we don't shadow the user's provider/key config), and the `~` is resolved by `pixtuoid_core::platform::home_first_dir` — **HOME-FIRST then USERPROFILE on Windows**, the OPPOSITE of pixtuoid's generic `USERPROFILE`-first `io::home_relative_checked`, because CodeWhale's own `effective_home_dir` is HOME-first; without this a Windows user who exports `HOME` (Git Bash/MSYS2/Cygwin) gets hooks written to `%USERPROFILE%\.codewhale\` while CodeWhale reads `%HOME%\.codewhale\` → installed-but-no-sprite. `default_config_path` mirrors CodeWhale's FULL precedence: `CODEWHALE_CONFIG_PATH`→`DEEPSEEK_CONFIG_PATH` (file overrides, absolute-only) → the modern app dir = `CODEWHALE_HOME` VERBATIM (it IS the `.codewhale`-equivalent dir, not a home base) else `<home>/.codewhale`, with the legacy `.deepseek` anchored to the OS home regardless of `CODEWHALE_HOME` (never shadow a real `.deepseek` config). **OpenClaw shares the same `home_first_dir`**: its `infra/home-dir.ts` resolves `$HOME ?? $USERPROFILE ?? os.homedir()` (HOME-first), so `install/openclaw.rs` mirrors `resolveStateDir`+`resolveConfigPath`: `openclaw_state_dir` = `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` → `OPENCLAW_HOME` → `home_first_dir()`, then prefer existing `.openclaw` else legacy `.clawdbot`; `default_config_path` = `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` → existing `openclaw.json` else legacy `clawdbot.json` in that state dir (was generic USERPROFILE-first `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` — the same Windows bug + env/legacy gaps). All three OpenClaw overrides are `~`-EXPANDED against that home via `io::expand_tilde` (OpenClaw's `resolveUserPath`/`resolveRawHomeDir` apply `^~(?=$|[/\\])`, #342) — and `detect_installed` applies the SAME expansion to the same env vars so install and detect can't diverge (a `~`-prefixed override that installs into `<home>/…` is also PROBED there, never at a literal `~/…` that exists nowhere → no "installed but the Sources panel won't offer it"). `CodeWhale`/`Reasonix` instead only TRIM their overrides (no `~`-expand — `cleanEnvDir`/`val.trim()`), so they pass `io::expand_tilde(.., None)`; don't "simplify" by blanket-expanding all targets — that would land a verbatim-taking CLI's hooks at the wrong path. Every OTHER target's CLI uses a USERPROFILE-first stdlib home, so they correctly stay on `io::home_relative` (which calls the generic `pixtuoid_core::platform::user_home_opt` directly — the former in-`io` home wrapper was deleted, so callers reach `user_home_opt` straight from `pixtuoid_core::platform`). `pixtuoid doctor` emits a Windows `home_split_advisory` when `HOME`≠`USERPROFILE` — the host condition under which any residual resolver mismatch would bite. The config is a `[hooks]` table with `enabled = true` plus a `hooks` ARRAY of `{event, command, _pixtuoid}` entries. Unlike Codex/Reasonix (one command for all events), CodeWhale sets NO event env var, so `hook_command` returns the BASE form (`PIXTUOID_SOURCE=codewhale '<path>'` / Windows bare `<path> --source codewhale`) and `merge_install` appends ` --event <name>` PER ENTRY; the shim's env-mode reads that flag + `DEEPSEEK_*` env (it must NOT read stdin — CodeWhale leaves env-only hooks' stdin = the TUI terminal). `enabled = true` is set on install ONLY when the key is ABSENT (CodeWhale gates all hooks on it, so a fresh install must enable them); an explicit `enabled = false` is the user's own global "all hooks off" switch and is left UNTOUCHED — we can't faithfully restore it on disconnect (no per-source install state since 0.12.0), so flipping it would permanently re-enable the user's OWN hooks. Ours then don't fire, but the verify/`doctor` `[hooks].enabled = false — none fire` note surfaces exactly that (not a silent no-sprite). Uninstall drops the `[hooks]` table only when nothing but our `enabled = true` remains — a surviving `enabled = false` (the user's) keeps its table. Detection probes `~/.codewhale`/`~/.deepseek` (presence_probe), and the `_pixtuoid` sentinel drives idempotency (the per-event command's last token is the event, so a command-basename fallback wouldn't apply). **opencode** is the odd one out — NOT a config block but a CODE artifact: opencode has no config-level shell hook (and SQLite-only sessions), so pixtuoid ships a TS plugin. opencode auto-discovers `<config>/plugins/*.{ts,js}` (plural — the canonical docs' dir; the anomalyco fork globs `{plugin,plugins}` so both work there, but plural is what canonical scans), so the target DROPS `<opencode-config>/plugins/pixtuoid.ts` (`OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` > `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode` > `~/.config/opencode`) — NO edit to the user's `opencode.jsonc`. The bundled `opencode_plugin.ts` (shim absolute path baked in JSON-escaped) pipes the lifecycle/tool/permission EventV2 stream to the shim on stdin (`--source opencode`). The plugin file is wholly pixtuoid's, so `merge_install` renders the whole file (changed = content diff, so a same-path re-install is a no-op) and reuses the ConfigLock/backup/atomic-write machinery; `merge_uninstall` writes a sentinel-free no-op stub (`export {}`) rather than deleting (the write-only orchestrator can't delete — an ACCEPTED residual; the stub is a harmless empty module), keying on the `@pixtuoid-opencode-plugin` sentinel for its changed-detection. Auto-detect (`presence_probe`/`detect_installed`) probes the opencode CLI's OWN dirs (`<config>` + `~/.local/share/opencode`), NOT our plugin file — keying on our own artifact would chicken-and-egg (opencode could never be auto-detected until after we'd installed into it), the same reason Reasonix/CodeWhale probe their CLI dirs. `hook_command` returns the absolute path (Err on non-UTF-8); `binary_strategy = EmbedAbsolute` (opencode runs the plugin under Bun, no PATH reliance — the per-target binary-resolution strategy is the `BinaryStrategy { BareNameOnPath | EmbedAbsolute }` enum on `Target`, replacing the old `needs_path_warning`/`needs_resolved_binary` bool pair). **Structured core, one DIRECT presenter of the install reports:** `install::install_target`/`uninstall_target` are the pure ConfigLock round (read→merge→backup→write, invariant #4 intact) returning an `InstallReport`/`UninstallReport`; the in-TUI **Sources panel** (`s` — see `src/tui/CLAUDE.md`) is the sole presenter that renders those reports directly (one-line result, hook path resolved via `hook_path=None`/`config=None`). There is no install-hooks CLI presenter anymore — `run_install`/`run_uninstall` were deleted with the `install-hooks`/`uninstall-hooks` subcommands. (No contradiction with the two-presenter sharp edge above: the scriptable `connect`/`disconnect` CLI is a second presenter of `crate::sources` OUTCOMES, one layer up — it surfaces install results only folded into those outcome rows, never the raw reports.) `has_hooks` is `pub(crate)` — its old cross-crate consumer (main.rs feeding `config::resolve_connected`'s migrate-default) went away when 0.12.0 dropped that inference; its callers are now `doctor` (both `diagnose`'s verify gate and `run`'s per-source `hooks_installed` report row) and `sources::skip_freeze` (the onboarding-skip freeze probes it so a pre-0.12 upgrader's hooks survive a skip).
- "How does the default character pack get into the binary?" → `pixtuoid_scene::embedded_pack` does the `include_str!` at compile time, now from the SCENE crate's own `crates/pixtuoid-scene/sprites/default/` (watched by `pixtuoid-scene`'s `build.rs` for rerun-if-changed); `sprite::format::load_pack_from_strings` parses it. (The binary's `init_pack` separately embeds `sprites/skeleton/` for `init-pack`.)
- "How do custom sprite packs work?" → `pixtuoid init-pack ./dir` extracts the skeleton template from `sprites/skeleton/` (embedded via `include_str!`, see `init_pack.rs`). `pixtuoid validate-pack ./dir` loads the pack and checks against `REQUIRED_CHARACTER_ANIMATIONS` / `OPTIONAL_*` registries in `sprite::format`. `--pack-dir` CLI flag or `pack-dir` config key loads a custom pack at runtime. Custom packs only need character sprites — furniture/environment animations are merged from the embedded default via `Pack::merge_from()` (only `OPTIONAL_FURNITURE_ANIMATIONS`, never character poses). The robot pack at `sprites/robot/` is a TV-head character set (10×12 sprites).
- "How does the crash log work?" → `crash.rs::install_crash_hook` (a bin-crate module, installed first thing by `main()`) sets a panic hook that restores the terminal, writes a timestamped backtrace to `~/.cache/pixtuoid/crash.log`.
- "Where do runtime errors / config warnings surface?" (#157, #87) → THREE sinks, by failure class. (1) **Always-on file log**: TUI mode installs a warn-floor file subscriber unconditionally (`logging.rs::init`; the alternate screen owns the terminal, so the file is the only runtime channel) — every `tracing::warn!/error!` (source deaths, decode failures, config warns) lands in `~/.cache/pixtuoid/log` (or `$XDG_STATE_HOME`/`$PIXTUOID_LOG`), one-deep rotated at 5MB. (2) **Pre-altscreen stderr**: `config.rs` resolvers (`load`/`resolve_theme`/`resolve_pets`) stay layer-clean and COLLECT human-readable warnings into a `&mut Vec<String>`; `main.rs` eprintlns them before `setup_terminal` (visible in scrollback after exit — the crash hook's channel; skipped in headless where the stderr tracing subscriber already shows them). (3) **In-TUI source-health footer**: a fatal `Source::run` exit is published as `SourceDeath` on a `watch` side channel (`SourceManager::spawn_with_health` — deliberately NOT an `AgentEvent`; the one event channel carries agent activity, invariant #2), threaded `driver.rs → run_tui → TuiRenderer::set_source_warning`, and `hud.rs::source_warning_message` renders a persistent footer warning that replaces the stats tier (the stats go stale when a transport dies) and survives every width + floor transitions.
- "How does config persistence work?" → `config.rs` defines `AppConfig` (theme + optional max-desks cap + pack-dir + `last_seen_version` (the version-popup stamp) + `[sources]` connected flags + `[floating]` window geometry (size/position/opacity — opacity is parsed + clamped to [0.2, 1.0] but an honest v1 no-op) + `[[pets]]`), `config_path()` (XDG-aware: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pixtuoid/config.toml` or `~/.config/pixtuoid/config.toml`; an empty/whitespace `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` counts as unset (the basedir spec defines EMPTY as unset; whitespace-only additionally fails its paths-must-be-absolute rule) — the shared `io::nonempty_env` filter, also used for `XDG_STATE_HOME` in main.rs's crash-log/log paths and for `PIXTUOID_HOOK`), `load()` (never crashes — logs warning on malformed TOML), `save()`/`save_version()` (route through `install/io.rs`'s ConfigLock — one lock across the whole read→mutate→write, fsync + atomic rename + perms preservation; they edit the raw document via `toml_edit`, so unknown keys and the user's comments/formatting survive; a config that EXISTS but doesn't parse is NEVER rewritten — the save errs and both callers warn-and-continue, and the first overwrite of an existing file takes a one-time `config.toml.pixtuoid.bak`), `resolve_theme()` (CLI > config > default; returns `Result<&'static Theme>` — the ONE place themes are validated: a `--theme` CLI typo is a HARD error listing valid names, a config typo is a soft warn+fallback so a stale config never bricks startup; `runtime::RunConfig` carries the already-resolved `&'static Theme`, so an unknown theme can't reach the runtime by construction). Theme saved on `[t]` picker Enter confirm in `tui/mod.rs`. `max-desks` is an optional cap — when set, auto-compute clamps each floor's capacity to `min(layout_capacity, cap)`. When absent, fully auto-computed from terminal size. `pack-dir` supports `~` expansion via `resolve_pack_dir`. **Per-source connection is `[sources]`** — a `BTreeMap<String, bool>` (`source_id → connected`), persisted by `save_source_connected` (via the same `toml_edit` ConfigLock path; `skip_serializing_if = is_empty` so a fresh config omits the table). **`resolve_connected(&AppConfig) -> HashSet<String>`** (pure, FS-free) is the boot seed for `runtime::ConnectedSources`: a source is connected iff its `[sources]` flag is an explicit `true` — an absent flag (or table) is plainly disconnected. (The v0.4–0.7 "absent flag MIGRATES from the install state" inference — connected-iff-hooks-installed via `install::has_hooks`, no-target sources defaulting connected — was DROPPED in 0.12.0: those configs are too old to keep supporting. Consequence, encoded in `setup.rs` tests: such an upgrader's config reads as a first run, so onboarding replays and IS their re-connect flow.) The Sources panel (`s`) is the only writer; the reducer task is the reader (gate + reconcile). **Pets are `[[pets]]` array-of-tables** — each `PetEntry { kind: String, name: Option<String> }`; `kind` is a raw String (NOT a serde `PetKind`) ON PURPOSE so a typo is warn-skipped in `resolve_pets`, not fatal (a typed enum would fail the whole `toml::from_str` → `load`'s malformed arm wipes EVERY setting). **`resolve_pets(&AppConfig) -> Vec<Pet>`** maps the stanzas → `Vec<Pet>` (`Pet { kind, name }`): absent `pets` → all kinds with default names; `pets = []` → none; unknown `kind` → warn+skip (non-fatal); `name` trimmed, empty/absent → `PetKind::default_name()`. No runtime kind→name map — the name rides on each `Pet`, so the renderer reads `pet.name` directly. No `enabled-pets`/`[pet-names]` keys (removed; backward compat is a non-goal). **`pets` MUST stay the LAST field in `AppConfig`** by convention — an array-of-tables serializes cleanest after all scalar keys (where `pet_names` used to sit); don't rely on toml's key/table interleaving.
- "How do multi-floor offices work?" → `pixtuoid_scene::floor` defines `FloorCtx` (per-floor render state: router/cache/overlay/history/**light** [LightingState]/motion) + `FloorTransition` (slide animation) + `build_floor_scene()` (agent projection — the engine half, see [`../pixtuoid-scene/CLAUDE.md`](../pixtuoid-scene/CLAUDE.md)). `tui_renderer/mod.rs` owns `Vec<PerFloor>` + one `PerOffice` (the session halves) and switches between them. Floor membership is stored on `AgentSlot.floor_idx` (set once by the reducer at desk assignment, immutable thereafter). Each floor's capacity is **boot-seeded from the actual terminal size** via `compute_boot_capacities()` in `runtime/driver.rs` (queries `crossterm::terminal::size()` at startup, falls back to `FALLBACK_DESKS=16` in headless mode or on error). Per-frame, `tui/mod.rs` derives each floor's capacity via `pixtuoid_scene::floor::floor_seed` + `floor_capacity` (uncapped by default since #421; min-clamped by the optional `desk_cap`) and writes the result via per-floor `AtomicUsize::fetch_max` (monotone growth — capacity never shrinks, preventing cumulative-offset shifts that would remap floor 1+ agents to wrong desks). The reducer syncs all `MAX_FLOORS` capacities into `scene.floor_capacities: [usize; MAX_FLOORS]` each tick. `next_free_desk` in `state/mod.rs` scans `0..total_capacity()`. On terminal shrink, agents beyond the layout's capacity become invisible but stay alive; they reappear when the terminal grows back. PageUp/PageDown/↑↓/jk in `tui/mod.rs`. Agents past a floor's capacity overflow to additional floors (up to `MAX_FLOORS=10`; only 5 layout variants exist, so floors 6-10 cycle through the same 5 looks).
