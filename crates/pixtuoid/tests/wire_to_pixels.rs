//! TRUE end-to-end: real wire bytes → the production decoder → a real
//! `Reducer` → a `SceneState` → the REAL `TuiRenderer` (ratatui `TestBackend`)
//! → an actual pixel buffer, asserting a sprite was PAINTED.
//!
//! The `tui_renderer.rs` integration test starts from a hand-built `AgentSlot`
//! — it proves the renderer paints, but skips the decode+reduce half. These
//! tests close that gap for EVERY supported source: they start from the SAME
//! real fixture bytes the conformance harness decodes (a captured transcript
//! line, a captured hook envelope, a captured daemon-presence envelope), run
//! them through the SAME production decoder (`registry::line_decoder()` for a
//! transcript source, `decode_hook_payload` for a hook source, the openclaw
//! presence decoder for the daemon), fold the resulting `AgentEvent`s through a
//! real `Reducer` (or `apply_presence` for the daemon), and render the scene to
//! pixels — proving real bytes become a visible character (or lobster), not
//! just a slot.
//!
//! Three transport classes are covered:
//!   - JSONL transcript  → `Transport::Jsonl` (claude-code, codex, antigravity, copilot)
//!   - agent hook         → `Transport::Hook`  (reasonix, codewhale, opencode, cursor)
//!   - daemon presence    → the sibling channel (`apply_presence`) (openclaw)
//!
//! The agent assertion is a pixel-diff FLOOR: an occupied frame must repaint
//! materially more subpixels than the same office with no agent, both rendered
//! through the IDENTICAL settle sequence so their (time-of-day) skies cancel —
//! what remains is the agent's own paint (recolored sprite, shadow, name label,
//! monitor glow). (A raw distinct-COLOR count was a timezone lottery: the sky palette, keyed off
//! `chrono::Local`, swamped the sprite's few colors at bright hours.) The
//! daemon assertion counts the lobster's exclusive carapace-red pixels (its
//! sprite is not recolored, so its authored RGBs render exactly).
