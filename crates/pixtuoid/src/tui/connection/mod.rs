//! The Connection panel: a modal listing every agent CLI with its connection
//! state (bound / unbound) and its live activity. This module is the PURE model
//! — no ratatui. The painter lives in `tui::widgets::connection`; the event-loop
//! wiring lives in `tui::mod`.
//!
//! Rows are the UNION of install targets and registry sources, keyed on the
//! source id (`SourceDescriptor.name`, joined to an install target via
//! `Target.core_source` — NOT `Target.name`, which differs for Claude). A row's
//! `state` is driven by the live connected-set (the persisted per-source intent),
//! NOT by whether hooks happen to be installed: connecting a source opens its
//! gate (characters appear); disconnecting closes it (characters walk out) AND,
//! for target-bearing sources, removes its hooks. Users bind/unbind a source;
//! they never think in terms of hooks vs JSONL.
