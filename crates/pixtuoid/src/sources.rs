//! The source-control CORE: detect / connect / disconnect / reconcile, TUI-free.

//! ONE home for "which agent CLIs exist, their connection state, and how to

//! (`tui::connection` + `tui::mod::{connect_source,disconnect_source}`), the
//! scriptable CLI (`pixtuoid sources|connect|disconnect`, Raycast-facing), and
//! first-run onboarding (`crate::setup`). The mutating ops here are the
//! PERSISTED half — they write the `[sources]` flag + install/uninstall hooks,
//! exactly as the panel does, but DON'T touch a running instance's live
//! `ConnectedSources` (a separate CLI process has none; a running `run`/`floating`
//! reflects the change on its next launch). The panel adds the one live line on
