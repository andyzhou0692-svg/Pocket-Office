//! Headless office → `RgbBuffer` rendering for the `pixtuoid floating` desktop window.
//!
//! This renders the office to a raw pixel `RgbBuffer` via the shared scene seam
//! (`pixtuoid_scene::floor::render_floor`, #423) — NOT the half-block terminal emulation
//! `examples/snapshot.rs` saves (snapshot writes the ratatui `TestBackend` → a ▀-compressed
//! PNG via `save_backend_as_png`). A floating-only surface: no `draw_scene`, no `Terminal`,
//! no shared output with snapshot. `floating::window` renders at a DOWNSCALED buffer
//! (~window/SCALE) and nearest-neighbor upscales it, so the pixel-art office stays
//! chunky/legible instead of 8×12-px-tiny at 1:1. This module just paints the buffer at
//! whatever dims it's handed, owning the per-frame caches plus the persistent office state
//! (coffee cups, group chitchat) across frames so motion stays continuous.
