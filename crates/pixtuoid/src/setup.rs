//! `pixtuoid run` (the TUI) plays a one-time "move-in" overlay on its first ever
//! launch; the headless `pixtuoid setup [--yes]` presenter (in `main.rs`) is the
//! scriptable twin (Raycast / CI / scripting). The signal lives here as ONE pure
//! predicate so both surfaces — and their tests — agree on what "first run" means.
//!
//! `pub` (not `pub(crate)`) because the binary's `main.rs` is a separate crate
//! from this lib and computes it in `build_run_config` (the same reason
//! `install::has_hooks` is `pub`).

/// file exists but is malformed/unreadable, so `config::load` fell back to
/// defaults and `cfg.sources` is empty regardless of what's really in the file).
/// An existing-but-broken config means "previously configured", NOT "first run":
/// replaying onboarding over it would (a) mislabel a long-time user as new and
/// (b) funnel them into an apply whose every write is refused by the
/// malformed-config-never-wiped rule (`update_config`) — a flow that cannot
/// succeed. The caller passes `!load_warnings.is_empty()` right after `load`
/// (a missing file returns defaults WITHOUT a warning, so it stays a first run).
///
/// The second arm mirrors `config::resolve_connected`'s MIGRATE condition (an
/// absent `[sources]` table falls back to install-state defaults): a user who
/// has never bound a source through the panel/CLI is, by the same token, a user
/// who has never been onboarded. Once any connect/disconnect persists a flag the
/// table is non-empty and onboarding never re-triggers — even a *disconnected*
/// flag (`false`) counts as "seen", since the table is non-empty.
