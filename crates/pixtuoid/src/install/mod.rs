    // INVARIANT (#387 — the code-artifact verify-coverage guard): `install_target`
    // ships a target's CODE via exactly two write paths — the merged `config_path`
    // (covered by `verify_schema`: opencode's plugin IS its config) and the
    // wholly-owned `extra_artifacts` dir (covered by verify_target's existence
    // stat, #332). A config can verify clean while the plugin FILES the runtime
    // actually loads are missing/clobbered — the silent-dead class doctor exists to
    // catch. This loops EVERY `extra_artifacts` target (today only OpenClaw) so a
    // future 3rd code-artifact target is AUTO-guarded: install → confirm sound →
    // delete the artifacts the target itself declares → assert verify goes
    // HARD-broken. A new code-shipping path added to `install_target` with no
    // matching check in `verify_target` fails this guard.
