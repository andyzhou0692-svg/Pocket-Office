//! Install-schema verification — the "silent-dead source" detector (#309).
//!
//! A source the user CONNECTED (hooks installed) renders ZERO sprites when its
//! install is structurally broken — the most confusing silent failure. We can't
//! tell "broken" from "the CLI isn't running" by counting events (that was
//! red-teamed out of #308), but we CAN deterministically verify the install we
//! ourselves wrote is still sound. This module is that check: pure, read-only,
//! false-positive-free.
//!
//! Three (four for CodeWhale) checks, all over the on-disk config:
//!   1. our `_pixtuoid` sentinel is still present,
//!   2. EVERY registered event still has a managed entry (catches an OLDER
//!      pixtuoid install missing newly-registered events — e.g. SubagentStart/
//!      Stop — which `has_hooks` passes but is silently half-dead),
//!   3. the embedded shim binary exists + is executable,
//!   4. (CodeWhale) `[hooks].enabled == true` (it gates ALL hooks on this).
//!
//! Per-source FORMAT knowledge stays in each `install/<target>.rs` `verify_schema`
//! (invariant #3) — this module holds only the shared result types, the shell
//! shim-path extractor (4 targets share `shell_hook_command`), and the
//! filesystem layer (`verify_target` in `mod.rs` stats the shim).
