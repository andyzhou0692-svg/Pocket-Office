//! Y-sorted drawable enum (painter's algorithm).
//!
//! Top-down depth: every mid-ground entity carries an `anchor_y` = the
//! y-pixel row where it touches the floor (front-facing bottom edge for
//! items with thickness). Drawables sort ascending by `anchor_y` and
//! paint in order. Larger `anchor_y` = closer to camera = paints last
//! (on top). Solves the classic "character standing south of a desk
//! should appear in front of it" problem without per-pair special cases.
//!
//! What stays OUTSIDE the sort:
//!   - Background (floor / walls / lighting / corridor / room walls /
//!     entry mat / clock / shadows). All depth-independent.
//!   - Per-character attached effects (chair-behind, sleep_z,
//!     waiting_bubble, walking dust, coffee steam, screen glow)
//!     paint AS PART of their parent `Drawable` — they ride along with
//!     the entity in z-order, not as a global foreground pass.
