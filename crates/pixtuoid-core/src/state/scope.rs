//! The agent **scope** layer (Layer B) — the parent↔subagent tree and the
//! lifecycle rules that propagate along it.
//!
//! The reducer runs two stacked state machines: the per-agent FSM (Layer A —
//! `Idle / Active / Waiting` plus the exit + debounce lifecycle, in
//! [`super::reducer`]) and this **scope** layer over `AgentSlot.parent_id`. The
//! scope encodes one invariant — *a subagent's lifetime is contained in its
//! parent's* (structured concurrency / an OTP-style supervision tree) — and
//! expresses it as a few directional operations the reducer delegates to.
//!
//! Housing them here gives the containment invariant a single home: a new
//! lifecycle concern becomes a function in this module rather than yet another
//! bespoke `parent_id` walk bolted onto the reducer (which is exactly how this
//! logic accreted before — cascade, then liveness, then readiness, then
//! completion, each a separate reactive scan).
//!
//! - **exit flows DOWN** — [`cascade_exit`]: a node leaving takes its whole
//!   subtree. Used by `SessionEnd`, the stale-sweep, `reconcile_connected`
//!   (Sources-panel disconnect), and subagent-completion — see its `StampRoot`
//!   doc for the per-caller root-stamp intent.
//! - **liveness flows UP** — [`refresh_lineage`]: a working descendant keeps its
//!   ancestors alive, so a blocked-but-delegating parent isn't stale-swept.
//! - **readiness, queried UP** — [`has_waiting_ancestor`]: a node blocked under a
//!   `Waiting` ancestor is "not ready", not dead (liveness vs readiness, k8s-style).
