//! `HookRouter` — the single honest owner of the ONE shared hook socket that
//! EVERY source's hooks ride (Codex, Reasonix, CodeWhale, opencode, Cursor, and
//! the OpenClaw daemon). It used to be bound as a side-effect of
//! `ClaudeCodeSource` (a transcript watcher that "happened to" host the socket);
//! lifting it here makes CC a pure `JsonlWatcher` and gives the hook plane a
//! dedicated owner.
//!
//! It implements [`Source`] DELIBERATELY: `Source::run` already hands the one
//! `(Transport, AgentEvent)` sender `handle_conn` sends on, and
//! `SourceManager::spawn_with_health` *generates* the `SourceDeath` that surfaces
//! a fatal exit in the TUI footer (#157) — so the router inherits that path for
//! free instead of rebuilding it. It is INFRASTRUCTURE, not a CLI: it has NO
//! `REGISTERED_SOURCES`/descriptor/badge row (the add-a-CLI checklist does not
//! apply); `source_set_includes_the_hook_router` closes the spawned-but-untested
//! gap.
