///
/// WHY a side-channel: a multi-turn Codex child (parent `send_input`) gets a
/// `SubagentStop` hook at EVERY turn end but no `SessionStart` carrier of any
/// kind at turn N+1 — upstream provides none (codex-rs hook_runtime.rs:
/// `UserPromptSubmit` fires only for direct user input, child-context events
/// carry the ROOT session_id, `SubagentStart` fires only at thread startup) —
/// and the hook-side end never touched the watcher's `seen` claim, so turn
/// N+1's appends decoded as unknown-id no-ops forever. Releasing the claim
/// when the hook end is decoded turns the next append into the JSONL
/// first-sight `SessionStart` the reducer's child ledger (#244/#246) re-links
/// to the remembered parent.
///
/// PRODUCER: the tee inside `HookRouter::run` (the `HookRouter` owns the ONE
/// shared socket ALL sources' hook payloads ride), so every `SubagentStop`
/// (CC and Codex alike) passes that single seam. CONSUMERS: each WIRED source's
/// `JsonlWatcher` (via [`JsonlWatcher::with_child_end_unclaims`] — CC and
/// Codex today; Antigravity stays unwired, nothing stamps its ends
/// `as_child`) drains only
/// the ids matching its OWN claimed paths; foreign ids stay pending for the
/// watcher that owns them (`AgentId` is source-namespaced, so there is
/// exactly one owner) until the TTL prunes them.

/// * **Release = `seen` → `false`, not removal.** The path must stay KNOWN:

///   rollout, so a removed claim would let `revouch_gated_files` reset the
///   cursor to 0 on the next scan — a full stale-activity replay plus an
///   instant re-registration that negates the SubagentStop end. A released
///   claim is skipped by the re-vouch sweep (it keys on `contains_key`) and
///   revives only on genuinely NEW bytes through `emit_first_sight`.
///
/// Accepted residuals: bytes the child wrote between the hook Stop and this
/// drain are consumed silently (indistinguishable from pre-stop stragglers
/// without per-byte timestamps) — the next append re-registers, and an active
/// turn appends continuously; and a revival start landing inside the slot's
