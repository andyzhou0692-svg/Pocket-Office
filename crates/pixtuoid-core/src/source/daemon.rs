//! The shared, daemon-AGNOSTIC presence layer. A "daemon" source (the OpenClaw
//! gateway is instance #1) produces NO agent activity — it has no desk, no
//! `AgentSlot`. Instead it earns ONE presence-gated wandering mascot whose
//! motion encodes the daemon's liveness (idle ambles, busy shuttles, down walks
//! out). This module owns the state machine + lifecycle that is identical for
//! EVERY daemon; the per-daemon WIRE decode (e.g. `openclaw::decode_openclaw_
//! hook_payload`, which maps a gateway envelope → `Vec<DaemonPresenceUpdate>`)
//! stays in the daemon's own module, exactly like an agent source owns its own
//! line/hook decoder.
//!
//! Presence rides a SIBLING channel (invariant #2: NOT the one `AgentEvent`
//! channel), carrying `PresenceMsg { source, delta }` so N
//! daemons land in DISTINCT `SceneState::daemons` entries. The reducer task
//! merges them via [`apply_presence`], NEVER through `Reducer::apply` (which is
//! `AgentId`-pure). See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-source-kind-daemon-
//! agent-decouple-design.md`.
