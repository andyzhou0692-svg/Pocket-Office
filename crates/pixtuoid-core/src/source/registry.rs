//! The per-source fact table — ONE row per agent CLI for every cross-source
//! registry core needs (label prefix, JSONL decoder, hook keying, reducer
//! capability flags). Before this existed those facts were scattered across
//! `reducer::source_label_prefix`, `decoder::decode_hook_payload`'s id-key
//! branch, and `conformance::decoder_for` — each individually
//! test-enforced, but adding a CLI meant restating "this source exists" in
//! 5+ files. Now it's this table + the source's own module.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT in the table (the scatter there is load-bearing):
//! - The `Source` trait impls and their JsonlWatcher wiring (label derivers,
//!   session-end checkers, id derivers): each source's `run()` uses its own
//!   module's fns directly — that's per-source code in a per-source file,
//!   not a cross-source registry, and mirroring it here would only add
//!   dead-data drift risk.
//! - `_pixtuoid_source` attribution + the shared CC-shaped hook arms: they
//!   stay in `decoder.rs` at the read site, pinned by their regression tests.
//! - The binary crate's `install::Target` registry (this table's design
//!   precedent) and `runtime/driver.rs` source spawning.
