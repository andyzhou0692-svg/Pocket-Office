//! `pixtuoid-web` — the WebAssembly canvas painter over the `pixtuoid-scene`
//! engine. The THIRD painter (alongside the binary's `tui` + `floating`): it
//! runs the real render+sim engine in the browser and blits each frame of the
//! shared `pixtuoid_scene::floor::render_floor` seam (#423) into a `<canvas>`
//! — the live office hero, NOT a gif.
//!
//! A sibling thin caller of the same seam as the binary's painters (no window,
//! no terminal): an [`Office`]
//! handle owns everything cross-frame so motion/pose stay continuous, and
//! `step(now_ms, w, h)` renders one frame into an RGBA staging buffer JS reads
//! zero-copy via [`Office::frame_ptr`]/[`Office::frame_len`] → `ImageData`.
//!
//! Time is a PARAMETER (`now_ms` from JS): the engine never calls
//! `SystemTime::now()` (it panics on wasm32-unknown-unknown).
