# PR Review Rules for pixtuoid

## Setup

Read `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root first. It contains architecture invariants, known sharp
edges, and conventions that are load-bearing. Your review must be grounded in that context.

Then read `gh pr diff` to understand all changes in this PR.

## What to review

Focus exclusively on HIGH-confidence findings. Every finding must be something you verified
by reading actual code — no guessing, no "this might be an issue."

### Must check

1. **Architecture invariant violations** (the 6 invariants in CLAUDE.md):
   - `pixtuoid-core` OR `pixtuoid-scene` importing terminal/window dependencies
     (ratatui, crossterm, winit, softbuffer) — both crates are backend-free by
     the crate boundary + `just arch`; terminal/window code lives only in the
     `pixtuoid` binary's painters over the engine's render seam
   - Events bypassing the typed `mpsc` channel or hardcoding `Transport::Hook`
   - Source implementations not going through the `Source` trait
   - `install::install_target`/`uninstall_target` not going through the `ConfigLock` round (`write_config_atomic`) for settings.json
   - Hook shim doing anything other than exit 0 on error
   - Walkable mask blocking more than ground footprint

2. **Real bugs**: logic errors, off-by-one, race conditions, missing error propagation.

3. **Missing test coverage**: new behavior without a corresponding test (this repo is TDD-first).

4. **`unwrap()` in non-test code**: always a finding.

5. **Scope creep**: changes that add v2 features or speculative abstractions not in the v1 spec.

6. **Stale docs**: if the PR changes module structure, architecture, or public API without
   updating CLAUDE.md/README.md.

7. **Duplication / DRY**: for each new fn, type, helper, or const the diff adds, search the
   tree (`grep -rn` / `rg`) for a pre-existing implementation of the same behavior — a
   diff-scoped read CANNOT see this, you MUST look OUTSIDE the diff. Flag a second copy that
   should delegate to the canonical one, especially when the two can DIVERGE (the real cost):
   two `expand_tilde`s drifted apart into a Windows `~\` bug; `lerp_rgb` was a no-op wrapper
   renaming `mix_lab` (a cheap-sounding name over an expensive call — a lying wrapper is the
   same finding); `Frame`/`RgbBuffer` each re-hand-rolled `Grid<T>`'s row-major buffer. This is
   the ONE check that requires searching the codebase, not just reading the diff.

### Escalate by what the diff touches

The checks above apply to every PR; these fire only when the diff touches a
high-risk seam, and they require looking BEYOND the diff. The **`risk radar`
workflow** (`scripts/risk-radar.py`, advisory) auto-detects these seams by path
and posts the matching checklist as a sticky PR comment — it is a deterministic
backstop for this section (prose-only escalation slipped both bot and local
review in #198), NOT a replacement for the judgement below:

- **`crates/pixtuoid-hook/**` (the shim)** → audit the WHOLE shim, not just the
  diff. It must use `args_os()` not `args()` (a non-UTF-8 argv panics → non-zero
  exit, visible to CC), do no slicing/indexing on untrusted bytes, bound every
  read, and route every error path to a silent `exit(0)`. Invariant #5 is the
  most-documented contract here, yet a prod `env::args()` once slipped both the
  bot and local review (#198).
- **`motion/` / `pose/` / walk-leg behavior** → not diff-readable. State in your
  summary that a human must render and WATCH it (an animation via the snapshot
  example, or `scripts/replay-fixture.sh` for resume/lifecycle motion) before
  merge — five walk regressions once shipped behind an unchecked "live run" (#61).
- **reducer / liveness ladder / sweeps** → trace the downstream interaction graph
  (rebind, TTLs, cascade, dedup), not just the changed lines; the bug is usually
  in an interaction the diff doesn't show.

### Do NOT flag

- Formatting or style (rustfmt enforced in CI)
- Missing comments or docstrings (repo convention: no comments unless WHY)
- Clippy warnings (enforced in CI with `-D warnings`)
- Speculative future issues ("this could become a problem if...")
- Anything cargo-deny, cargo-machete, or CI already catches
- Performance unless measurable (this is a TUI rendering ~30fps, not a hot loop)
- Absence of defense-in-depth where a PRIMARY defense already exists (a missing
  belt when the suspenders hold) — matches the two-lens protocol's negative space
  (`pr-review.prompt.md`); a genuinely missing PRIMARY guard is a real bug, flag that

## Anti-hallucination protocol

- Every file:line you cite MUST be from a file you actually read with the Read tool
- Do not invent line numbers. If you can't find the exact line, describe the location
- If you're unsure whether something is a bug or intentional, check "Known sharp edges" in CLAUDE.md before filing
- Verify your premise before each finding: does the code actually do what you think it does?
- Never claim an external artifact (GH Action tag, crate release, sibling
  repo/tap) "does not exist" or "is the wrong version" from memory — training
  data is stale by construction. Verify via `gh api`/the registry in this
  session first: a 404 you observed is evidence, a recollection is not. If
  this environment can't reach the registry, say "unverified" at most — do
  not assert. (Repeat offenses: `checkout@v6` in #80, the homebrew tap in
  #112 — both existed.)

## Severity

- **HIGH**: must fix before merge — real bug, invariant violation, missing critical test
- **MEDIUM**: worth fixing — scope creep, stale docs (a genuinely missing PRIMARY
  defense is a real bug → HIGH, not a MEDIUM defense-in-depth nit; see Do NOT flag)

No LOW findings. If it's not worth fixing, don't mention it.

## Output format

- Post inline comments on specific lines via `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment`
- Cap at 5 findings total
- Always post exactly one summary comment via `gh pr comment`, even on clean PRs:
