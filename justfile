#   site     — the Astro landing page under site/ (npm, its own CI)
#   gen      — regenerate committed artifacts (README sections + docs images + site demos)
#   release  — cut a new version (bump) + the distribution gates (npm-check / notes)
#   meta     — tooling setup + the full pre-push / full-stack gates
