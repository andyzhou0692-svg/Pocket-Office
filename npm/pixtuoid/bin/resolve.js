//   • linux-x64   ships a STATIC musl build (portable to glibc too) — the
//     package declares no `libc`, so it installs on every linux-x64 host.
//   • linux-arm64 ships a glibc build — its package declares `libc:["glibc"]`,
//     so npm skips it on musl/Alpine-arm64 (where it would crash) rather than
//     installing a broken binary.
// The os/cpu/libc filtering happens at npm INSTALL time; here we just map.
