"""Upstream wire-format drift watch.

pixtuoid decodes the CC and Codex CLI wire formats (hook event names, the
subagent-dispatch tool name). Those names change upstream WITHOUT notice — the
`Task` -> `Agent` rename shipped undocumented and silently disabled subagent
suppression. This script verifies that the names we depend on still exist at the
canonical upstream sources, so CI can flag a break before it reaches a user.

It reads what we depend on directly from our own source (no snapshot file to rot)
and compares against the live upstream:

  * Codex hook events  -> `CODEX_EVENTS` in crates/pixtuoid/src/install/codex.rs
                          vs the `HookEventName` enum in openai/codex protocol.rs
  * Codex rollout types-> the `("event_msg"|"response_item", …)` decode arms in
                          crates/pixtuoid-core/src/source/codex.rs vs the `EventMsg`
                          enum (protocol.rs) + the `ResponseItem` enum (models.rs).
                          The transcript decoder drops an unknown type SILENTLY
                          (`_ => vec![]`, no breadcrumb), so this positive check —
                          each depended type still exists upstream — is its ONLY backstop
  * CC hook events     -> `EVENTS` in crates/pixtuoid/src/install/claude.rs
                          vs the hook-event summary table in code.claude.com
                          hooks.md (CC is a closed binary; the docs markdown is
                          the only watchable surface)
  * CC dispatch tool   -> the known names in `make_tool_detail`
                          vs the tool list in code.claude.com tools-reference
  * Reasonix hooks     -> `REASONIX_EVENTS` in crates/pixtuoid/src/install/reasonix.rs
                          + the payload fields decode_rx_hook_payload reads
                          vs the `Event` consts / json tags in
                          esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix internal/hook/hook.go
  * CodeWhale hooks    -> `CODEWHALE_EVENTS` in crates/pixtuoid/src/install/codewhale.rs
                          vs the snake_case `HookEvent` enum in
                          Hmbown/CodeWhale crates/tui/src/hooks.rs
  * opencode events    -> the EventV2 `type`s the decoder maps (the `match event`
                          block in crates/pixtuoid-core/src/source/opencode.rs)
                          vs the `EventV2.define` type literals in
                          anomalyco/opencode packages/schema/src/v1/session.ts +
                          packages/schema/src/permission.ts
                          (one-directional: only a VANISHED depended type alarms)
  * Copilot events     -> the event `type`s the decoder maps (the `match kind`
                          block in crates/pixtuoid-core/src/source/copilot.rs)
                          vs the per-event `type` consts in the published
                          @github/copilot-<os>-<arch> session-events JSON schema (unpkg)
                          (one-directional: Copilot emits ~100 event types and we
                          map ~10 by design, so only a VANISHED depended type alarms)
  * Cursor hooks       -> the camelCase `hook_event_name`s we register
                          (CURSOR_EVENTS in crates/pixtuoid/src/install/cursor.rs)
                          vs the hook-event names on cursor.com/docs/hooks
                          (one-directional: Cursor exposes ~18 hook events and we
                          map ~5 by design, so only a VANISHED depended event alarms)
  * Hermes hooks       -> `HERMES_EVENTS` in crates/pixtuoid/src/install/hermes.rs
                          vs the `_DEFAULT_PAYLOADS` shell-hook event keys in
                          NousResearch/hermes-agent hermes_cli/hooks.py
                          (one-directional: Hermes fires ~15 shell-hook events and
                          we register 4 by design, so only a VANISHED depended event alarms)

Beyond the event/TYPE lists above, FIELD-NAME drift is watched wherever the
upstream field owner is fetchable (a rename → the decoder reads None and the
sprite silently breaks — the same class as a vanished type): Reasonix payload
json tags; Codex EventMsg/ResponseItem rollout types + FunctionCall name/arguments;
CodeWhale DEEPSEEK_* env vars (HookContext::to_env_vars); opencode Struct fields;
Copilot schema `properties`; OpenClaw hook-types fields; Hermes _serialize_payload
keys (agent/shell_hooks.py). Cursor + CC (closed binaries, docs-prose only) and
Antigravity (no fetchable schema) CANNOT be field-watched — the in-code drift
breadcrumbs (defense #2: drift::missing_field/unknown_event) are the limit there.

Exit codes:
  0  no drift
  1  actionable drift (a name we depend on vanished, or a new upstream Codex
     or CC hook event we neither register nor intentionally omit) -> open a
     tracking issue
  2  could not check (network/HTTP error) -> transient, do NOT alarm

# sweep ONLY, because CC persists NO structural end record in transcripts
# today (135-transcript corpus, 2026-06; the content-based /exit matcher was
# removed — chat content must never drive lifecycle). Two surfaces we want to
# ADOPT the moment they exist upstream:
#   * a structural transcript end record (`subtype:"session_end"`) —
#     `cc_session_ended` already decodes it; the docs mentioning it means CC
#     started persisting it and the JSONL transport gains a durable end signal.
#     Adoption note: the liveness-probe first-sight bypass (`probe_admits` in
#     core's source/jsonl.rs) deliberately skips the gate's ended tail-scan
#     because no such marker exists today — when one lands, admission needs an
#     ended-check before bypassing the gate.
#   * the `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` registry ({pid, sessionId, startedAt,
#     cwd, procStart, status}) — the input the liveness probe consumes
#     (#224/#227; shape drift is consumer-warned in live_cc_session_ids, #247).
# All markers are ABSENT from hooks.md at add time (verified live); a hit is
