# OpenClaw + Claude-Code-backend COMBINED live-e2e — the REAL end-to-end proof of
# the OpenClaw daemon design premise (`source/openclaw.rs` module doc): the
# gateway DAEMON renders as the wandering "Molty" mascot (presence), WHILE its
# bundled `claude-cli` backend coding session renders as a full-fidelity `cc·`
# desk sprite. One headless scene, two sources, two sprites:
#
#   agents=[… cc·<workspace>@N …] daemons=[openclaw:busy]
#
# Flow:
#   1. headless pixtuoid binds an ISOLATED socket + watches ~/.claude/projects
#   2. `openclaw gateway run` (PIXTUOID_SOCKET pointed at that socket so its
#      pixtuoid plugin reaches THIS instance) -> gateway_start -> Molty idle
#   3. `openclaw agent --message …` routes ONE turn to the claude-cli backend ->
#      before_agent_run -> Molty busy AND a real `claude` writes ~/.claude/projects
#      -> a NEW `cc·` sprite (label = the openclaw workspace cwd basename)
#   4. assert a backend cc· label (absent from the pre-gateway baseline) AND
#      openclaw:busy were both observed; then tear the gateway down
#
# ⚠ REAL side effects — UNLIKE the synthetic shim-driven `openclaw-live-e2e.sh`,
# this is NOT hermetic and NOT a CI test. It starts YOUR gateway (the iMessage
# channel connects and could auto-reply to an inbound text during the ~30s
# window) and makes ONE real model turn on your Anthropic auth (the agent reply
# is NOT delivered to any channel — `--deliver` is omitted). Requires `openclaw`
# (with the pixtuoid plugin installed + a claude-cli backend agent) and `claude`.
#
# Build first:  just build --release
# Run:          scripts/openclaw-cc-backend-e2e.sh
