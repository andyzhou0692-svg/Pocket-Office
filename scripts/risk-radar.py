"""Risk radar — deterministic, advisory blast-radius surfacer for PR review.

Reads a list of changed file paths (one per line on stdin, repo-relative) and
prints a Markdown checklist of the review escalations that apply to the
high-risk seams the diff touches. It is a *lever, not a gate*: pure path
matching (NO LLM, NO network, NO model judgement), never blocks merge, and
emits no attestation artifact. It only SURFACES the audits the review prompts
(`.github/prompts/pr_review_rules.md` "Escalate by what the diff touches",
`.github/prompts/pr-review.prompt.md` "When two lenses aren't enough", and the
root `CLAUDE.md` invariants) already mandate — converting prose-only escalation
(which slipped both the bot and local review in #198) into something the PR
states outright.

SCOPE (deliberate): this covers **blast-radius / invariant** seams — code whose
change can break a contract, a platform, the office's rendered look, or a CI
gate. It does NOT cover *prose-quality* escalations (the editorial lens for
README/site/release-notes), which aren't blast-radius. Committed-art review is
keyed on the SOURCE change that alters the render (layout/theme/painter/…), not
on the regenerated `docs/images` / `site/public/demos` artifacts.

Anti-rot: each `Seam` names the doc anchor it mirrors (`source=`), and
`_selftest` asserts that anchor substring still exists in the referenced file —
so if someone removes/renames an escalation in the docs, the seam's grounding
goes red instead of silently drifting (the repo's `expand_tilde`-divergence
bug class). Adding a seam is ONE `Seam(...)` row + the per-path/anchor asserts
in `_selftest`.

Usage:
  git diff --name-only BASE HEAD | python3 scripts/risk-radar.py   # -> radar.md on stdout (empty if no seam)
  python3 scripts/risk-radar.py --selftest                         # exit 0 = matcher healthy
